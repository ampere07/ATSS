/**
 * Weekly agent referral invoices.
 *
 * Runs every Monday at 00:00 (Asia/Manila) and bills the seven days immediately
 * before the run — one invoice per team, one per agent who belongs to no team.
 * A run on Monday 17 August bills 10 August 00:00:00 to 16 August 23:59:59; the
 * day of the run is never included.
 *
 * Safe to run as often as you like. An owner already invoiced for the period is
 * skipped, and a customer already billed to that owner is refused by the
 * database, so a second run in the same morning creates nothing.
 *
 *     php artisan cron:generate-agent-invoices
 *
 * Options:
 *     --as-of=YYYY-MM-DD  bill as though the run happened on this date, i.e. the
 *                         seven days before it
 *     --week=YYYY-MM-DD   deprecated alias for --as-of. NOTE the meaning changed
 *                         with the move to a rolling window: it once meant "the
 *                         calendar week containing this date", and now means the
 *                         week BEFORE it. A notice is printed when it is used.
 *     --agent=ID          only the owner this agent belongs to (a team or
 *                         themselves), for testing one case
 *     --dry-run           report what would be billed without writing anything
 *     --quiet-log         write the run log without the per-customer detail
 *     --no-echo           do not mirror the run log to the console
 *
 * Every run writes a full log to storage/logs/agent-invoices/Agent_Invoices.log
 * in the same form as the auto-disconnect worker's: a banner, the configuration
 * it read, a numbered block per owner, and a summary with counts and a duration.
 * When run from the console the same lines stream to stdout as they are written.
