/**
 * AgentIncentiveService
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Cron logic that awards quota-based incentives to agents.
 *
 * For each agent it counts the agent's COMPLETED ("Done") Job Orders that have
 * not yet been counted, and for every full multiple of the agent's quota it
 * pays the configured `incentives_value` ONCE:
 *
 *     incentive earned = number of completed quotas x incentives_value
 *
 * A quota of 10 with an incentive value of 100 earns 100 per completed quota.
 * Reaching the quota is what earns the incentive; the referrals inside it are
 * what it takes to get there, not separately paid units. (Commission is the
 * per-referral part of the scheme and is unaffected by this.)
 *
 * Each full quota cycle is a "batch". An agent with 20 completed Job Orders and
 * a quota of 10 is awarded 2 batches in one run (10 Job Orders tagged to each),
 * and batch numbers keep incrementing per agent across runs (batch 1, 2, 3, …).
 * Any remainder (< quota) carries over unprocessed to the next run.
 *
 * PROGRESS IS NEVER RESET BY A RUN.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A run does not "start a fresh count". It asks one question — which of this
 * agent's completed Job Orders are NOT yet in `agent_incentive_history` — and
 * that set only ever grows until a quota completes. So an agent on a quota of 5
 * who has Customer 1 and Customer 2 today still has both tomorrow, counted
 * toward the SAME quota, however many times the cron runs in between. Nothing
 * is discarded for want of a full quota; the run simply reports progress
 * (2/5) and awards nothing.
 *
 * When the quota does complete, the opposite applies and it applies
 * permanently: every Job Order that made up the completed quota is written to
 * `agent_incentive_history` inside the same transaction that pays it, tagged
 * with that cycle's `batch_number`. From that moment those customers are
 * consumed — the `whereNotExists` below can never see them again, so they
 * cannot be counted toward a second quota or paid a second time. Only
 * customers arriving afterwards count toward the next one.
 *
 * Only Job Orders onboarded on or after `config('agent.start_date')` are in
 * scope; anything earlier belongs to the period before the scheme and earns
 * nothing. Achievement progress uses the same date, so the two always agree
 * about which of an agent's referrals count.
 *
 * Idempotency / no-double-pay is guaranteed two ways:
 *   1. Only Job Orders absent from `agent_incentive_history` are counted.
 *   2. Every counted Job Order is recorded in `agent_incentive_history`, which
 *      has a UNIQUE key on `job_order_id` — so even concurrent runs cannot
 *      record (and therefore cannot pay for) the same Job Order twice.
 *
 * Job Order ↔ Agent association follows the project's existing convention
 * (see CommissionController): Job Orders are linked to an agent through the
 * related application's `referred_by` full-name field. There is no agent_id on
 * job_orders today — see the note in the class docblock recommending one.
 *
 * NOTE (future improvement, intentionally NOT applied here): matching by
 * full name via `referred_by LIKE '%name%'` is inherently fragile (name
 * collisions, renames, partial matches). Adding an explicit `agent_id` column
 * to job_orders/applications and matching on it would be far more reliable.
