/**
 * AgentInvoiceService
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Builds the weekly referral invoice for every team and solo agent.
 *
 * An "owner" is whoever the invoice is addressed to: a team, or an agent who
 * belongs to no team. Agents are grouped by their `agent_id`, which is the team
 * they belong to on the `agents` table — an agent with none is billed alone.
 * A team therefore gets ONE invoice covering every agent in it, never one
 * invoice per member.
 *
 * A referral is billable when it was installed inside the billing week, on or
 * after the agent programme start date, and has not already been billed to this
 * owner. That last check is the important one, and it is enforced twice:
 *
 *   1. Customers already on an invoice for this owner are excluded up front.
 *   2. A unique key on (owner_key, application_id) refuses the write anyway.
 *
 * The second is what makes a repeated run safe. Two runs racing, a retry after
 * a timeout, or somebody running the command by hand on a Monday morning all
 * end the same way: one invoice, one row per customer.
 *
 * Everything for one owner is written inside a transaction, so a failure part
 * way through leaves no invoice rather than an invoice missing its customers.
 * One owner failing never stops the rest of the run.
